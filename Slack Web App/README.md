# BOWSHOT

BOWSHOT allows users to communicate with other users through direct, private messages or in group channels. Users are  able to join channels that are moderated by other users.

## Access

The app was located on an ec2 instance, but we do not have it running as of January 2020.

## Local Access
Tomcat and maven should be installed. Navigate to the tomcat directory, and run it with this command: 
`/catalina.sh start`. Then, navigate to the Development directory of this app. Run `mvn tomcat7:deploy` or `mvn tomcat7:redeploy` on the terminal. Visit http://localhost:8080/prattle/ to access the app. 

You can see this process in action here, in a short video from my teammate: https://youtu.be/IJTYS57qmBg


## Demo
I have created a 3 min demo of what this app looks like from a user's perspective with a voiceover. It can be watched here:
