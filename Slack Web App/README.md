# BOWSHOT

BOWSHOT allows users to communicate with other users through direct, private messages or in group channels. Users are  able to join channels that are moderated by other users.

## Access

The app was located on an ec2 instance, but we do not have it running. 

## Local Access
Tomcat and maven should be installed. Navigate to the tomcat directory, and run it with this command: /catalina.sh start 
Then, navigate to the Development directory of this app. Run mvn tomcat7:redeploy on the terminal. Visit http://localhost:8080/prattle/ to access the app. You can see this process in action here: https://youtu.be/IJTYS57qmBg


## Demo
I have created a demo of what this app looks like from a user's perspective. It can be viewed here:
